I am an incoming PhD student in Computer Science at [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en), co-advised by [Kim Baraka](http://kimbaraka.com/) and [Herke van Hoof](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/h.c.vanhoof/homepage/) (University of Amsterdam). My research is centered around interactive robot learning. Specifically, I study how robots can learn from multimodal feedback at various levels of abstraction and reason about their learning needs to actively request the right type of feedback at the right time.

Previously, I was a systems engineer at [Scania Group](https://www.scania.com/group/en/home.html), developing algorithms for battery management systems. Before that, I obtained my MSc in Robotics from [Warsaw University of Technology](https://eng.pw.edu.pl/), where I was advised by [Prof. Elżbieta Jarzębowska](https://www.meil.pw.edu.pl/daas/DAAS2/People/Elzbieta-Jarzebowska). Earlier, I completed my undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering at [Addis Ababa Science and Technology University](http://www.aastu.edu.et/) in Ethiopia.

**Research Interests:** Human-Robot Interaction, Interactive Robot Learning, Mathematical Human Modeling, Reinforcement Learning
